# Active Context

This document tracks the current state of development, recent changes, and immediate next steps for the MetaDyn website.

## Current Focus

The primary focus is on establishing a comprehensive and accurate Memory Bank for the project. This involves analyzing the existing codebase and creating foundational documentation that will guide all future development.

## Recent Changes

*   **Resolved Development Server Issue:** Fixed a 404 error that was preventing the `npm run dev` command from working correctly. The issue was caused by `output: 'export'`, `basePath`, and `assetPrefix` settings in `next.config.js` that are intended for static builds, not the development server. These have been commented out to allow for local development.
*   **Created Initial Memory Bank:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created.

## Next Steps

*   **Complete Memory Bank:** Finalize the initial creation of the Memory Bank.
*   **Full Site Audit:** Perform a full audit of the site's functionality, including the contact form and all animations, to ensure everything is working as expected.
*   **Await Further Instructions:** Once the baseline documentation and audit are complete, the project will be ready for new feature development or other requested changes.
