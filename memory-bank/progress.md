# Project Progress

This document tracks the development status of the MetaDyn website.

## What Works

*   **Core Application:** The Next.js application is running successfully in development mode.
*   **Homepage:** The main page (`app/page.tsx`) renders without errors.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and applying styles.
*   **3D and Animations:** The site incorporates 3D elements with Three.js and animations with Framer Motion.
*   **Component Structure:** The project is well-organized into a component-based architecture.

## What's Left to Build

*   **No new features are currently planned.** The immediate goal is to document and audit the existing application.

## Current Status

*   **Operational:** The website is functional from a technical standpoint.
*   **Documentation Phase:** The project is currently in a documentation and analysis phase. The Memory Bank has been established to ensure a clear and consistent understanding of the codebase for future work.

## Known Issues

*   **`next.config.js` for Production:** The `output`, `basePath`, and `assetPrefix` settings in `next.config.js` are currently commented out to allow the development server to run. These will need to be re-enabled and potentially adjusted for any future production builds or static exports.
